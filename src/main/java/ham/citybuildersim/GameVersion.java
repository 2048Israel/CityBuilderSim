/**
 * What build this is, and what shape its saves are.
 *
 * TWO NUMBERS, ON PURPOSE
 *
 * VERSION is for people: it goes in the window title and in every save, so a
 * bug report or a broken save says which build produced it. Bump it whenever
 * something ships.
 *
 * SAVE_FORMAT is for the loader, and it changes far more rarely - only when the
 * save's SHAPE changes in a way an older build could not read correctly. It
 * exists to catch one specific accident: opening a save from a newer build in
 * an older one. Without it the older build reads the fields it recognises,
 * silently ignores the rest, and hands back a city missing whatever the newer
 * build added - which looks like a working load right up until something is
 * quietly gone.
 *
 * Older saves are still read. That direction is safe: every field added since
 * has a sensible default, and the load path already handles the pre-slot,
 * pre-flow and pre-land formats.
 *
 * KEEPING IT IN SYNC
 *
 * VERSION also appears in "Build EXE.bat" as APPVER, because jpackage stamps it
 * into the exe and cannot read it from here. Two places, and this is the one
 * that matters - the other only affects the file properties dialog.

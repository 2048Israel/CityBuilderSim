/**
 * What build this is, and what shape its saves are.
 *
 * TWO NUMBERS, ON PURPOSE
 *
 * VERSION is for people: it goes in the window title and in every save, so a
 * bug report or a broken save says which build produced it. Bump it whenever
 * something ships.
 *
 * SAVE_FORMAT is for the loader, and it changes far more rarely - only when the
 * save's SHAPE changes in a way an older build could not read correctly. It
 * exists to catch one specific accident: opening a save from a newer build in
 * an older one. Without it the older build reads the fields it recognises,
 * silently ignores the rest, and hands back a city missing whatever the newer
 * build added - which looks like a working load right up until something is
 * quietly gone.
 *
 * Older saves are still read. That direction is safe: every field added since
 * has a sensible default, and the load path already handles the pre-slot,
 * pre-flow and pre-land formats.
 *
 * KEEPING IT IN SYNC
 *
 * VERSION also appears in "Build EXE.bat" as APPVER, because jpackage stamps it
 * into the exe and cannot read it from here. Two places, and this is the one
 * that matters - the other only affects the file properties dialog.

     * The save shape.
     *
     * 1 - the original flat save
     * 2 - land, and both tax rates
     * 3 - construction keyed by template id; the month's flows carried
     * 4 - numbered slots, names, and this stamp
     * 5 - the month's income statements carried whole, plus the utilisation
     *     they were written against. Roads needed nothing of their own: road
     *     capacity and road load are both pure functions of the building stock.
     * 6 - the land office's listing, iron deposits and reserves, the ore price,
     *     the mining sector's books, and the construction subsidy
     * 7 - parcels carry a DEPOSIT COUNT, so the listing is five fields per plot
     *     behind a marker instead of four. Reading downward is unaffected - a
     *     format-6 listing still loads, with any ore counting as one site, which
     *     is exactly what it meant. Upward is what this number is for: a build
     *     that only knows four-wide rows sees a length that divides by neither
     *     shape, throws the whole listing away, and silently hands the player
     *     ten new plots in place of the tract they were saving up for.
     * 8 - policy: the two city rates plus every wage-band and per-sector offset,
     *     which sectors the city has undertaken to subsidise, and the month's
     *     VAT ledger. An older build reads none of these and would hand back a
     *     city with one flat rate everywhere and nothing protected - a load that
     *     looks perfectly successful right up until the sectors start shrinking.
